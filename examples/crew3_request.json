Use diverse search strategies to find announcements from companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Microsoft, etc.\n\nCRITICAL ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES:\n- ONLY report URLs discovered through SerperDevTool\n- NEVER invent model names, dates, companies, or sources\n- If you cannot find information, explicitly state: 'No verified information found for [topic]'\n- Record exact URLs as returned by search tools\n- Mark confidence level for each finding (Verified/Likely/Uncertain)\n\nSEARCH STRATEGY:\n1. Search for '[Company] AI model release 2025' for major companies\n2. Search for 'AI framework release 2025' and 'LLM release 2025'\n3. Search company blogs directly: 'site:openai.com release 2025', 'site:anthropic.com release 2025'\n4. Search tech news: 'site:techcrunch.com AI model release 2025', 'site:theverge.com AI release 2025'\n5. Search for specific known models if any: 'GPT-5', 'Claude 4', 'Gemini', etc.\n6. Use date-specific searches: 'AI release January 2025', 'AI release Q1 2025'\n7. For each result, use WebsiteSearchTool to verify the content\n\nFOR EACH FINDING:\n- Model/Framework name (exactly as stated in source)\n- Company\n- Release date (use exact format from source, note if approximate)\n- Source URL (must be real and accessible)\n- Key information (direct quotes or paraphrased with attribution)\n- Confidence level\n\nIF YOU CANNOT FIND CERTAIN INFORMATION:\n- State explicitly what you could not find\n- Do NOT make up placeholders or examples\n- Focus on what you DID find with high confidence",

Focus on what was actually discovered rather than trying to create a comprehensive overview of everything that 'should' exist.\n\nCRITICAL ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES:\n- Use ONLY information from the researcher's findings\n- NEVER add model names, dates, or sources not in the research\n- If research is limited, write about what WAS found, not what you wish was found\n- Maintain exact URLs and citations from research\n- If you cannot verify a claim from research, omit it or note the limitation\n\nWRITING APPROACH:\n1. Start with what the research DID uncover\n2. Write engaging prose around verified facts\n3. Use direct quotes when available\n4. Group findings thematically (by company, by capability, by timeframe, etc.)\n5. Include a timeline section ONLY with verified dates\n6. Be honest about information gaps\n7. Keep tone informative but accessible\n8. Use inline citations [Source: URL]\n\nSTRUCTURE FLEXIBILITY:\n- Adapt structure to actual findings\n- If few releases found, focus on industry trends\n- If many releases, organize by category or timeline\n- Include 'What We Don't Know Yet' section if relevant",
