For each subtopic, use the search tool to find 5-10 highly relevant articles, studies, or reputable web pages4. Ensure diversity in your sources, including academic journals, industry reports, news articles, government publications, and reputable websites5. When possible, look for sources with differing perspectives or methodologies to provide a well-rounded view6. For each source, use the website tool to extract key information, data points, evidence, and author/source details7. Use multiple search queries with varied keywords to avoid bias in search results8. Consider using advanced search operators to find specialized information (e.g., site:.edu, site:.gov, filetype:pdf)9. For each source, record complete citation information including: author names, publication date, title, publisher/website name, URL, DOI (if available), and page numbers (if applicable)10. Assign each source a unique identifier [1], [2], etc., for easy reference11. When extracting information, maintain a clear link between each piece of information and its source using the identifier12. Evaluate the credibility and recency of each source using criteria such as author expertise, publication reputation, peer-review status, and currency13. Note the methodology used in research studies to assess the reliability of findings14. Organize findings by theme or subtopic, with each data point explicitly linked to its citation15.

IMPORTANT: Develop a completely original organizational framework based SOLELY on the research material, NOT on any predetermined structure or template3. Identify the main thematic areas that emerged from the research (could range from 3 to 15 major themes)4. For each thematic area, create a hierarchy of main topics and subtopics5. Consider whether a chronological, thematic, comparative, problem/solution, or other organizational approach best suits the material6. Determine if certain topics deserve greater emphasis (more sections) based on the amount and quality of research available7. Experiment with different possible structures before settling on the one that best presents the research findings8. Do not feel constrained by traditional report formats - create a structure that best serves this specific topic and research9. For each main theme, identify 3-7 key insights supported by multiple sources and specific evidence10. Conduct a citation analysis to identify which sources are most frequently cited or considered most authoritative11. Identify connections, relationships, and interdependencies between different themes and subtopics12. Compare and contrast different perspectives, methodologies, or conclusions found across the sources13. Always maintain the connection between insights and their original sources14.
