    "additional_information": "Biology research lab needs comprehensive tools for analyzing next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. Primary requirements: Handle large genomics datasets (100GB+ per sample), seamless integration with R and Python ecosystems, interactive and publication-quality visualization capabilities, support for common bioinformatics file formats (FASTQ, BAM, SAM, VCF, BED, GFF), efficient batch processing for multiple samples, cloud-compatible for scalability, reproducible workflow management with version control. Specific analysis needs: RNA-seq differential expression analysis, variant calling and annotation, ChIP-seq peak calling, metagenomics analysis. Budget constraints: Academic/non-profit pricing models strongly preferred, approximately $5k/year budget for software licensing and compute. Team composition: 3 computational biologists with strong programming skills, 2 wet lab researchers with basic command-line experience. Current infrastructure: Mix of local HPC cluster and AWS cloud resources, primarily Linux-based systems. Looking for tools that balance power-user capabilities with accessibility for less technical team members."
