Identify primary keywords and concepts related to the topic\n2. Break down the topic into at least 5-10 subtopics or aspects to explore\n3. For each subtopic, use the search tool to find 5-10 highly relevant articles, studies, or reputable web pages\n4. Ensure diversity in your sources, including academic journals, industry reports, news articles, government publications, and reputable websites\n5. When possible, look for sources with differing perspectives or methodologies to provide a well-rounded view\n6. For each source, use the website tool to extract key information, data points, evidence, and author/source details\n7. Use multiple search queries with varied keywords to avoid bias in search results\n8. Consider using advanced search operators to find specialized information (e.g., site:.edu, site:.gov, filetype:pdf)\n9. CRITICAL - USE CITATION TOOL: For EVERY source you find, immediately add it using the CitationManager tool:\n   - If source has DOI: {\"operation\": \"add\", \"doi\": \"10.xxxx/xxxxx\"}\n   - If source has PMID: {\"operation\": \"add\", \"pmid\": \"12345678\"}\n   - If source is a URL: {\"operation\": \"add\", \"url\": \"https://...\"}\n   The tool will automatically:\n   - Validate the source exists (prevents hallucinations)\n   - Extract complete metadata (authors, title, journal, etc.)\n   - Assign citation number [1], [2], etc.\n   - Return formatted reference\n10. NEVER manually create citations - always use the CitationManager tool\n11. If tool reports \"validation failed\", the source doesn't exist - find a different source\n12. After adding all sources, validate them: {\"operation\": \"validate\"}\n12. Evaluate the credibility and recency of each source using criteria such as author expertise, publication reputation, peer-review status, and currency\n13. Note the methodology used in research studies to assess the reliability of findings\n14. Organize findings by theme or subtopic, with each data point explicitly linked to its citation\n15. Consider perspectives with 5 depth\n16. Focus on content type: detailed report\n17. Document any conflicting evidence or viewpoints\n18.
